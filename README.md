# Qwerty: A minimal longform writing theme.

Qwerty is a minimal, responsive, longform writing theme. 

Great care has been taken to remove all unnecessary elements. You won't find any external javascript dependencies*, complex image sprites, or heavy web fonts. 

We wanted to build the fastest, lightest weight theme we could. It's about displaying your content without the bloat, making your site load much faster than a typical WordPress theme.

*Conditional javascript is included for IE8 support.
